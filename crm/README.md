This document provides instructions to set up and run the CRM application, including Celery and Redis.

## Prerequisites
- Redis running at `redis://localhost:6379/0`
- Python virtual environment activated

---

## 1. Install Redis and Dependencies

### Install Redis:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install redis-server

# MacOS (using Homebrew)
brew install redis
Start Redis service:

sudo service redis-server start

Install Python dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run Database Migrations

Apply all Django migrations:

python manage.py migrate

3. Start Celery Worker

Run the Celery worker for the CRM app:

celery -A crm worker -l info


This will process background tasks for your CRM application.

4. Start Celery Beat

Start Celery Beat to handle scheduled tasks:

celery -A crm beat -l info


This will schedule periodic tasks defined in the CRM app.

5. Verify Logs

Check the log file to ensure tasks are running properly:

cat /tmp/crm_report_log.txt


You should see logs indicating that the heartbeat and scheduled tasks are being processed.
